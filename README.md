## About me
My repos are not really that useful and there just there so I have them. I sometimes (very rarely)
contribute to other projects... except for CrackleSDK (pinned here)! I'm
[codingisfun2831t](https://forum.snap.berkeley.edu/u/codingisfun2831t/) on the Snap! forums and
community site, as it is the same here.
